# Decision Tree - Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
### What is this?
- Decision tree can be used for regression and classification problems
- The prediction in this algorithm are made by traversing the tree from root to leaf. Each leaf is associated with a class which is the output of the predictor
- At each node in our tree, we go left if a feature is less than a threshold. Otherwise, we go right.

### Why we are using this?
- Because, we are aim to create a model that can use to predict the class or value by just make a simple decision rules as I said before.
- By simple it means that, we follow the node corresponding to that value and jump to the next node in our tree

### How is this algorithm work?
- Its ok to mix data types in the same tree
- You start at the top and get the way down and down untill you get to a point where you can not go any further(leaf in the tree)
- There several method:
    - Gini Impurity
    - Entropy
    - Information gain
