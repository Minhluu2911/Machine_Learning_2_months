# BASIC Machine Learning 2 months
I'm challenging to myself to learn Machine Learning Algorithms, as much as I can within 2 months :pout:

### Managing the python environment
- I'm recommend you using Anaconda to manage your python environment. It's very easy to use and handle.
- Here is my quick guide to manage your environment :point_right: [How to use Anaconda](https://github.com/Minhluu2911/Managing-Environment-Using-Anaconda)

### Some Algorithm that I think I will cover:
The list will be updated and added additional algorithm in the progress when I learning.

- Getting familiar with:
  - [x] Numpy.
  - [x] Pandas
  - [x] Matplotlib
  - [ ] Seaborn
- Supervised Learning
  - [ ] Linear Regression
  - [ ] Logistic Regression
  - [ ] K-Nearest Neighbor
  <!-- - [ ] Support Vector Machine (SVM) -->
  - [ ] Decision Trees and Random Forests
  <!-- - [ ] Neural networks -->
- Unsupervised Learning
  - [ ] K-Means
  <!-- - [ ] DBSCAN
  - [ ] Gaussian Mixture -->

### A little bit change of my view (I hope that you spend a little bit time to read it)
- I have received some advices from my teacher so I think that I will change a little bit my point of view:
  - **Firstly**, my target of this repo is that I want to implement the algorithm from the scratch by myself If I can in order to understand thoroughly so it cost me a lot of time to do this. On the other side that I also must to handle my schoolwork in the university because it's quite heavy in this semester and I do not want drop it out. :cry:. I decide to cut back on some part that I think we must spend a lot of time to understand it in in detail and add some fundamental parts to get familiar with machine learning.
  - **Secondly**, I think that learning is the long-term road, especially machine learning is not an easy bite so I do not want to do it as the *fast food* and try to equip for myself a strong foundation for the future. My plan is I will divide this into 3 parts: Basic, Intermediate and Advanced.
     - In basic, I try to get familiar with machine learning tools and basic term so that when I go deeper I will not be frustrated or discouraged. Solving many small problems that make us flexible and confidence after knowing how to use it and when to use it.
     - When you have familiar, then in the intermediate and advance it quite not difficult as it is.
- I'm very sorry about the change of my view might cause inconvenience for people who have been following me. However, I think this is the best way for both of me and you in the long road.
