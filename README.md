# Machine Learning 2 months
I'm challenging to myself to learn Machine Learning Algorithms, as much as I can within 2 months :pout:

### Managing the python environment
- I'm recommend you using Anaconda to manage your python environment. It's very easy to use and handle.
- Here is my quick guide to manage your environment :point_right: [How to use Anaconda](https://github.com/Minhluu2911/Managing-Environment-Using-Anaconda)

### Some Algorithm that I think I will cover:
The list will be updated and added additional algorithm in the progress when I learning.

- Supervised Learning
  - [ ] Linear Regression
  - [ ] Logistic Regression
  - [ ] K-Nearest Neighbor
  - [ ] Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - [ ] Decision Trees and Random Forests
  - [ ] Neural networks
- Unsupervised Learning
  - [ ] K-Means
  - [ ] DBSCAN
  - [ ] Gaussian Mixture
